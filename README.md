# HTML-ADHD
Some HTML codes
## Description :
Often times when I'm doing coding, random ideas come to my mind. I like to **tinker around with my ideas**, I often branch out with that, sometimes end up with exhaustion, and sometimes I end up learning something new. 
Initially I used to think of it as a waste of time, bcuz I am there to hone my skills, but what I'm doing is delving into unnecessary details, but then I realised that balance is the key.
_This repo is for all those codes_
